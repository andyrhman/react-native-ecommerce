# React Native Ecommerce

This project is from a course i got on udemy, i took interest on react native since i have studied react and then i got me thinking why not study the react on mobile to improve my frontend skills.

## First Time Configuration

```bash
mkdir myapp
cd myapp
npx create-expo-app .
```

## Install some dependencies

```bash
npm i @react-navigation/native @react-navigation/native-stack react-native-paper
```
